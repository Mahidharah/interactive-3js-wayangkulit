# Log File
This file is a collation of all the work done individually.

## Week 1
- Familiarised with tech stack (Node, npm, 3js)
- Set up organisation and repository
- Discussed to use forking workflow
- Set up a sample project of an orbiting cube with spot and ambient lighting

### Challenges
- Figured out difference between standardmesh and basicmesh (standardmesh requires lighting)

## Week 2
- Organised code in an OOP manner
- Attempted to create 3d models on blender
- Created demo models on 3js with cube geometries and implemented key listeners to move model
- Formulated a JSON schema for standardising coordinate and dimention information for each puppetpart
  
### Challengs
- Allighning coordinates of each puppet part
- Creating a proper 3d model

### Looking Forward
Namely 2 approaches
1. Create multiple 3d models for each part and stitch them together in 3.js / cannon.js
2. Create on 3d model for the whole pupper and stitch them in blender / solidworks, then augment the model in 3.js / cannon.js

	> We plan to do so with simple placeholder models (3d oval/circle planes)
Figure out the challenges and implementation of these 2 approached and document findings and rationale of decision
