## Assets Directory

### Overview
This directory contains all assets relevant to the project. 

To upload puppet image assets: 
- Name each of the 4 components as "arm.png", "hand.png", "body.png", and "stick.png"
- Store them within a folder titled puppet_XX where XX is the index of the puppet as specified in this document. 
- All images must contain the png image alpha (i.e. the transparency information) within the png image file
    -  This should be done by default.

Non-image puppet assets include:
- The relative coordinate information about the components stored in a custom data structure (TBC)
- The 3D-models if needed (TBC)
